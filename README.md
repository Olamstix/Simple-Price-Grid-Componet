### What I learned

I learnt how to use flexbox layout and how it works.

```
.column-1, .column-2 {
    -webkit-flex: 1;
    -ms-flex: 1;
    padding: 20px;
}
```


### Continued development

I would love to get to know more about flexbox, there's alot to do with it


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox layouts. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
